_For this call, you are encouraged to turn your video on. This is a good way to build rapport given we are a large, disparate group experiencing a lot of churn._

_This document is live-edited DURING each call, or shortly after the call, and stable/authoritative copies live on our github repo under /agenda.md .
Please note that we might not notice a pullrequest in time, but you are free to propose agenda items for future meetings via hackmd._

## Kickoff Meeting - 23 June 2021 - (time in ET)

### Agenda
### Brainstorming about possible TOPICS for the group:

During the kick off call on the 23.06.2021  the group brainstormed and collected topics for the wg-applied crypto. In the next step we need to clarify which topics are relevant.

SSI cryptographic protocol topics
	- BBS+ (supports the ability for predicate proofs)
	- Revocation methods
	- Which crypto primitives we should use / we recommend:
		- Curves,etc.

General cryptographic topics relevant for SSI:
	- Java Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE)
	- Fuzzy encryption
	- Use of Pseudonyms (stable ID between holder and verifier -> for a recovery method without correlation)

Education, Description and Definitions:
Definitions, glossary and concepts for onboarding and education.
Focus on good sources and links and explaining what we use in the group an mean
	- Group signatures
	- Message encryption
	- Multi message Signatures
	- Zero knowledge Proofs (SNarks, SPARCs,….)
	- Cryptographic Accumulators
	- Predicate proofs (membership and non membership proofs)
	- Pairing crypto 
	- Definitions of problems in SSI which we can maybe solve with crypto
		- Correlation
	- PoV to actual topics
	- Different kind of attacks on crypto
	- Organise code/security reviews of libraries we use 
	- Review of crypto papers
